      <h1>To my bae,</h1>
      <p>Ive been sat here for co<span>U</span>ple of minutes thinking, planning and trying to get my best words dow<span>N</span>. Ive got high hopes for this write up, perhaps to be the best poem she's ever rea<span>D</span> or at least the best Ive written to anyone.</p>

      <p>Well the words aint coming, Ive got too much to say, th<span>ER</span>e are too many angles to <span>T</span>ake on or Im just not good enough - s<span>H</span>it time is running out!</p>

      <p>Wait a minute, this is about h<span>E</span>r and Ive just been ranting about my inadequacies for a whole paragraph, how else could I have shown my typical selfishness. everything has to always <span>B</span>e about me.</p>
      
      <p>What about what she wants, her desires her goals her family and her priorities. I keep lieing to myself that Im doin all these for both of us and that when I succe<span>E</span>d we both do - how about the other way around?</p>

      <P>Have I ever wondered what she wouldve been without me, what restrictions Ive place<span>D</span> on her thats standing in d way of her dreams?</p>

      <p>Well Im guilty. I dont do enough, Im lazy like a big baby she has to take care of perpetually. I only have my heart to give, I certainly hope she could manage it like that.</p>

      <p>So to my terrific woman, contrary to what my actions or even words prove sometimes Ive got a lot of deference for you; my best friend who takes me as I am, even when I judge myself bitterly, shes the voice that still believes in me....</p>

      <p>...makes me feel at least Ive got a fan. Please dont desert me - I want u for d rest of my life. Im dirty, imperfect of the imperfect, I will b stupid and make mistakes pls dont unfriend me.</p>

      <p>Now Ive successfully written this whole piece about me!</p>

      <p>Happy birthday to my MVP - text aint adequate to describe what u are. Great things are waiting to happen from u. I did it! managed to write a paragraph without me in it - oops I still got two "I"s in there - hopeless boy uve got here :(</p>

      <p>oh btw, weird capitals makes us see more - wont you agree?</p>
